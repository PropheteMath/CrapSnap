CrapSnap by Mathieu Monnier - 2014

This is crapsnap, a snapchat client for "old" blackberry os devices :
==> BBOS 6, 7 & 7.1 devices such as bold & curve 9900, 9930, 9320, 9360, 9350, 9315, 9810, 9720...
I've uploaded the full Eclipse project. You will found the sources in "src", and the binary files in "bin", 
the UI images in "res" and the final files (the ones you need to install it on your Blackberry) in "deliverables". 

Previously, crapsnap was realeased as a paid app on the app world, but Blackberry unsubmitted it because it wasn't compliant
with the TOS of snapchat (wich specify third parties clients aren't allowed to connect to theirs servers). 

Feel free to download or improve this piece of software !
