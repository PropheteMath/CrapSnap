A snapchat client for old blackberry devices

Hi everybody !
This is crapsnap, a snapchat client for "old" blackberry os devices :
==> BBOS 6, 7 & 7.1 devices such as bold & curve 9900, 9930, 9320, 9360, 9350, 9315, 9810, 9720...
I've uploaded the full project. You will found the (dirty) sources in "src", and the binary files in "bin", 
the UI images in "res" and the final files (the ones you need to install it on your Blackberry") in deliverables. 

Previously, crapsnap was realeased as a paid app on the app world, but Blackberry unsubmitted it beacause it wasn't compliant
with the TOS of snapchat (wich specify no custom client, as CrapSnap for example).
So instead of keeping it on my hardrive for nothing, I decide to put it on github, if somebody want to download or improve it
(theire is a lot to do !), you're welcome !

Mathieu Monnier.
